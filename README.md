# Datastores & Search Application Design

## Loads:
- 10 mins presentation
- 8 slides
- 8-10 pages of report

## Deliverables
- Introduction
- Dataset
- Persisted Data Model and Datastores
  - Describe your user and tweet data model in detail (preferably with diagrams).
  - Describe how you stored the data in the datastores.
  - What did you optimize for? What were the tradeoffs?
  - Did you create any indexes for the datastores?
- Processing tweets for storing in datastores
  - Make sure that you processed the tweets and stored the information (users, tweets) in the datastores one at a time (DO NOT load all the data into a dataframe and then load the dataframe into the datastore)
- Search Application Design
  - What types of searches are allowed? What kinds of drill-downs are allowed?
  - How were search queries translated into queries for the datastores?
  - What was your notion of relevance (i.e. how did you order the results of the search queries)?
  - How is the cache used?
- Results
  - Show the results of each type of query.
  - Timings of your test search queries (make sure you are hitting cached and non cached data)
- Conclusions
  - What are your conclusions regarding your design and experiments?
  - What did you learn from the project?
- References
- List what each team member did for the project.

> Goal: Efficiently store the data for fast access.  

### 4 Parts of the Projects  
 - Datastores  
 store the information in the tweets in at least 2 datastores.
   - relational datastore
   - non-relational datastore
 - Cache  
Design and implement a cache for storing "popular" (frequently accessed) data.
 - Search Application  
Design a search application for your tweet store. You must provide several options such as search by string, hashtag,Â  and user at the minimum.
